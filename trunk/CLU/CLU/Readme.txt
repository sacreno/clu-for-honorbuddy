Description
==========
This CC is mainly intended for PVE users of honorbuddy, however it can still be used for PVP it will simply use the PVE Rotation at the moment. (Class Specific PVP rotations may be added in the future).
It will perform its rotation according to online resources such as Elitist Jerks & SimulationCraft, leaving you to monitor more important things such as fight mechanics.

Rotation Selector
--------------------

Clu has the special abiltie to load Custom Rotations. This means you can copy an existing rotation and modify it to your needs and CLU will load it for you to use.

1) goto "%Your Honorbuddy Folder%\CustomClasses\Classes\" folder and select the class folder you want to custimize.
2) copy and paste the rotation file you want to change.
3) rename the file to a different name (i.e. Elemental.cs to Elemental_v2.cs)
4) open the file you just renamed and look for the line that says "class Elemental : RotationBase" and change it to "class Elemental_v2 : RotationBase".
5) in the same file look for the line that says "public override string Name { get { return "Elemental Shaman"; } }" and rename it to public override string Name { get { return "Elemental Shaman v2"; } }
6) Make any necassary changes to the rotation you want.
7) Congradulations you just made a custom rotation file of your own. When you next run CLU it will prompt you to select a rotation.
